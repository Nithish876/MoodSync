My goal is to display the moods like color mixer & word bubble on widgets of own user & selected friends.

Users own Mood: means current users recorded mood
Friends Mood: users selected friend moods

Widget Size
Size of widget is same cross all platforms. comes in follwing sizes:

1. 2\*2 grid

- 2\*2 grid for users own mood.
- 2\*2 grid for friends mood.

2. 4\*2 grid

- 4\*2 grid for users both own mood & friends mood side by side.
  Here user have to choice choose color mixer bubble & word cloud bubble.

when user clicks on widgets they need to be redirected to edit screen,

##Edit Screen
In edit screen
2 option to select

1. own mood
2. friends mood

if users select friends mood they get list of friends they can add ---> (click) on save

later they select option button between color mixer & cloud bubble

click on save.

##my goal
i think you are confusing updating mood means. we want to dispay following
""

1. 2\*2 widget
   a. My Mood (Users own mood) 1. color mixer 2. word bubble
   b. Friends Mood : 1. color mixer 2. word bubble

2. 4\*2 widget
   side by side
   on left side users own mood (My mood) on right side friends mood
3. color mixer 2. word bubble
   ""
   this is my above goal rember.
   the 'edit screen' i keep talking is the screen which appears when click on widgets. for ex: widgets (click)--> opens the app --> opens edit screen (which only updates that widget only)

for refernce i attached screen shoot of color mixer & world cloud
the color mixer file is @ColorMixer.tsx & @WordCloud.tsx is the files dont update this code. we want to display this things on widget. did you get it.
