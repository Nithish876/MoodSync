== FIRESTORE INDEX SETUP HELPER ==

You need to create the following indexes in your Firebase project to fix the widget update issues:

1. For widget updates with compound queries:
   Collection: widgetUpdates
   Fields to index:
   - friendIds (array-contains)
   - timestamp (ascending)

   Direct URL to create this index:
   https://console.firebase.google.com/v1/r/project/mood-sync-app/firestore/indexes?create_composite=ClNwcm9qZWN0cy9tb29kLXN5bmMtYXBwL2RhdGFiYXNlcy8oZGVmYXVsdCkvY29sbGVjdGlvbkdyb3Vwcy93aWRnZXRVcGRhdGVzL2luZGV4ZXMvXl8QGRhdGVzZGF0cBAQgwKCF9bmEtZ9fEAl

2. For notifications:
   Collection: notifications
   Fields to index:
   - recipientId (equal)
   - read (equal)

   Direct URL to create this index (if needed):
   https://console.firebase.google.com/v1/r/project/mood-sync-app/firestore/indexes

NOTE: Creating these indexes may take a few minutes to complete.
Until the indexes are ready, the app will use a fallback approach
that doesn't require the indexes.

== IMPORTANT DEBUGGING STEPS ==

If your widgets still don't update automatically:

1. Check if you've installed Firebase messaging:
   npm install @react-native-firebase/app @react-native-firebase/messaging

2. Rebuild your Android app:
   cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..
   npx react-native run-android

3. Check logs for error messages (Filter by "widget" or "notification")

4. Test with the fallback methods:
   - Friend widgets should update every 2 minutes when app is open
   - Widgets should update every 30 seconds when app is in background
   - Update immediately when a notification is received

5. Make sure FCM notifications are properly configured in Firebase Console:
   https://console.firebase.google.com/project/mood-sync-app/messaging
